# AWS Cloud Practitioner
## ‚òÅIntroduction to AWS
- pay-as-you-go: you only pay for what you use, don't pre-pay for anything.
- Deployment models for cloud computing
	- on-premises: a¬†private cloud¬†deployment.
	- hybrid-cloud: cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.
	- all-in cloud: all parts of the application in the cloud.

## ‚òÅCompute in the Cloud
- [All AWS Server Introduction](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/products/compute/)
- [AWS Compute Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/)
- [Hands-On Tutorials: Compute](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/)

### Amazon EC2
- [Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/): a virtual server. highly flexible, cost effective, and quick
- [Amazon EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)¬†are optimized for different tasks.
	- General purpose instances
	- Compute optimized instances
	- Memory optimized instances
	- Accelerated computing instances, such as graphics applications, game streaming, and application streaming.
	- Storage optimized instances, include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
- pricing
	- [On-Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/pricing/on-demand/): short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply.
	- [Savings Plan](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/savingsplans/): A commitment to a consistent amount of usage measured in dollars per hour for a one or three-year term.
	- [Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/): These are suited for steady-state workloads or ones with predictable usage. You qualify for a discount once you commit to a one or three-year term and can pay for them with three payment options:
		- all upfront
		- partial upfront
		- no upfront
	- [Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/spot/pricing/): They allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off of the On-Demand price. AWS can reclaim the instance at any time they need it, giving you a two-minute warning to finish up work and save state.
	- [Dedicated Hosts](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/dedicated-hosts/): Physical hosts dedicated for your use for EC2
- Scaling EC2: scalability and elasticity

	- key factors to choose a Region
		- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
		- Proximity to your customers
		- Available services within a Region: Sometimes, the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers.
		- Pricing
- Availability Zone: An¬†Availability Zone¬†is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region.

	- Virtual Private Cloud is essentially your own private network in AWS.
	- define your private IP range for your AWS resources
	- place things like EC2 instances and ELBs inside of your VPC
- A¬†subnet¬†is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
	- Public subnets¬†contain resources that need to be accessible by the public.
	- Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network
- connect VPC gateway
	- Internet gateway(IGW): An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet.
		![Cloud Practitioner_07_Internet gateway](https://github.com/MickeyHuang233/CodingStudyNote/blob/main/04_%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93/02_%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0/AWS/%E2%98%81AWS%20Cloud%20Practitioner/images/Cloud%20Practitioner_07_Internet%20gateway.png?raw=true)
	- Virtual private gateway: Virtual private gateway establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate network.
		![Cloud Practitioner_08_Virtual private gateway](https://github.com/MickeyHuang233/CodingStudyNote/blob/main/04_%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93/02_%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0/AWS/%E2%98%81AWS%20Cloud%20Practitioner/images/Cloud%20Practitioner_08_Virtual%20private%20gateway.png?raw=true)

[Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)¬†divides into customer responsibilities (commonly referred to as ‚Äúsecurity ==in== the cloud‚Äù) and AWS responsibilities (commonly referred to as ‚Äúsecurity ==of== the cloud‚Äù).

### AWS IAM
[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)¬†enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

- An IAM policy is a JSON document that describes what API calls a user can or cannot make.
- **IAM user**
- **IAM group**
- **IAM¬†policy**¬†is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.
```json
{  
	"Version": "2012-10-17",  
	"Statement": [  
		{  
			"Sid": "MyListBucketStatement",   
			"Effect": "Allow",  
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",  
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::com.test.demo.file",
				"arn:aws:s3:::com.test.demo.images",  
				"arn:aws:s3:::com.test.demo.notes" 
			]  
		}  
	]  
}
```
- **IAM roles**¬†is an identity that you can assume to gain ==temporary== access to permissions.¬†When someone assumes an IAM role, they abandon all previous permissions that they had under a previous role and assume the permissions of the new role.
- In IAM, [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/iam/features/mfa/) provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account.

### AWS Organizations
[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations)¬†is as a central location to manage multiple AWS accounts.

- Centralized management of all your AWS accounts.
- You can use the primary account of your organization to consolidate and pay for all member accounts.
- You can group accounts into organizational units, or OUs.
- You can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using¬†[Service Control Policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html).
- An SCP affects all IAM users, groups, and roles within an account, including the AWS account root user.
